# Commands related to a remote repository:
1. git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
2. git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)
# Commands related to the workflow:
1. git add .

### The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

### For example,

1. git add . is read as 2. git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
3. git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
4. git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
